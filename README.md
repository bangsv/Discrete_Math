# Discrete_Math
12 different tasks for working with arrays
Restrictions on the algorithm and program

1. Do not use global parameters.
2. Do not use dynamic memory.
3. All arrays must be of the same type. In arrays, the first elements contain useful information (given numbers or the result of solving a problem), in the rest - garbage. For each array, there must be a variable that stores the number of array elements with useful information.
4. Do not use additional arrays and other data structures in the function.
5. A function must not call other functions.
6. Enter the initial data (arrays A and B) in the main program, and not in the functions for solving the problem.
7. Output the result of the task (array C) in the main program, and not in the function for solving the problem.
8. In solving options 8â€“12, you cannot use nested loops, as well as a loop that simulates a nested loop.
